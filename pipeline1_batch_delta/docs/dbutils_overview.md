🧠 What is dbutils in Databricks?
🔧 dbutils is a Databricks utility library that provides programmatic access to:

🔐 Secrets (via dbutils.secrets.get(...))

📂 File systems (via dbutils.fs)

📋 Widgets for parameter input (in notebooks)

🔄 Notebook chaining and job control

📁 Mounts (for blob storage, ADLS, etc.)

It’s injected into the notebook context automatically.

✅ When do you need dbutils?
Situation	Use dbutils?	Why
Reading from SQL Server via JDBC	✅ Yes	You’re retrieving secrets (sql-user, sql-password, etc.)
Reading from Unity Volumes / CSV	❌ No	No secrets or Databricks-specific utilities needed
Using Secrets from Key Vault	✅ Yes	Need dbutils.secrets.get(...) to pull connection strings or keys
Local testing with .py scripts	⚠️ Maybe	You need to import DBUtils manually or avoid using dbutils calls

⚠️ Why your SQL version needs dbutils
Your SQL connector script is using this line:

python

jdbc_url = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="databricks-secrets-lv426", key="sql-jdbc-url")
💥 That requires dbutils to work — otherwise you get a NameError.

Compare that to your bronze_finances_invoices_ingest.py:

You're reading a plain CSV from Unity Volumes

No secrets = no dbutils = less complexity ✅

🧰 When working with Secrets in .py (non-notebook)
Use this boilerplate to safely define dbutils:

python

# Safe definition for dbutils across environments
try:
    dbutils
except NameError:
    from pyspark.dbutils import DBUtils
    dbutils = DBUtils(SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate())
✅ You should place this before any line that uses dbutils, and after your Spark session is created (or pass the session into it).

💡 Summary
dbutils is only needed when your script uses Databricks-native features like secrets or filesystem utils

In CSV-based or Unity Volume pipelines, you can skip it

If you do use it in .py scripts, always import it safely
