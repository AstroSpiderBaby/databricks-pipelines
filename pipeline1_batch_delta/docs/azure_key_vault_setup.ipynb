    "# Azure Key Vault Setup for Databricks\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide outlines the detailed process to configure Databricks to use Azure Key Vault-backed secret scopes, along with CLI barriers encountered and how they were resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîê Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Key Vault-backed secret scopes allow you to securely store secrets (like storage account keys) in Azure Key Vault and reference them in Databricks without hardcoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß± Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* Azure Key Vault already created\n",
    "* Secret added to Azure Key Vault\n",
    "* You have `Owner` or `Contributor` access to the subscription/resource group\n",
    "* Azure CLI installed and logged in\n",
    "* Databricks CLI v0.256+ installed and configured\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Azure Key Vault Details Used\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Vault Name:** `databricks-secrets-lv426`\n",
    "* **Secret Name:** `lv426-storage-key`\n",
    "* **Storage Account Name:** `datalakelv426`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Generate AAD Token (used for authorization)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az account get-access-token \\\n",
    "  --resource=https://management.core.windows.net/ \\\n",
    "  --query accessToken -o tsv > token.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use this token in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Create Secret Scope Using Azure Key Vault (in Git Bash or WSL)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X POST https://adb-<your-instance>.azuredatabricks.net/api/2.0/secrets/scopes/create \\\n",
    "  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(cat token.txt)\" \\\n",
    "  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "  -d '{\n",
    "    \"scope\": \"databricks-secrets-lv426\",\n",
    "    \"scope_backend_type\": \"AZURE_KEYVAULT\",\n",
    "    \"backend_azure_keyvault\": {\n",
    "      \"resource_id\": \"/subscriptions/fa554798-6d63-42a2-8469-f61166c72476/resourceGroups/databricks_AstroSpider/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/databricks-secrets-lv426\",\n",
    "      \"dns_name\": \"https://databricks-secrets-lv426.vault.azure.net/\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ If successful, your secret scope is now available to Databricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Barriers Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå CLI Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "* CLI v0.18 did not support `--aad-token` (needed for legacy)\n",
    "* Needed to use `curl` with manual token\n",
    "* v0.256 CLI expects `--json` with token and still failed unless `userAADToken` was passed\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå PATH Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both CLI versions were installed (`v0.18` and `v0.256`)\n",
    "* Had to ensure `databricks` pointed to correct version or use `curl` directly\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Syntax Errors in JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quotes, escaping, and payload formatting were sensitive. Easier to build `curl` one-liner in VS Code then paste into Git Bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "databricks secrets list-scopes --profile DEFAULT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Scope                            Backend Type\n",
    "------------------------------  -------------\n",
    "astro_keyvault                  DATABRICKS\n",
    "lv426                           DATABRICKS\n",
    "databricks-secrets-lv426        AZURE_KEYVAULT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© Usage in Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "secret_scope = \"databricks-secrets-lv426\"\n",
    "secret_key_name = \"lv426-storage-key\"\n",
    "\n",
    "storage_key = dbutils.secrets.get(scope=secret_scope, key=secret_key_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Done! You can now securely use your Azure Key Vault secrets inside Databricks.\n",
