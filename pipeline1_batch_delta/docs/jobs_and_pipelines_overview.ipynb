    "# ðŸ§± Jobs and Pipelines in Databricks\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides a quick overview of how Databricks Jobs and Workflows are used to orchestrate modular pipelines.\n",

    "## ðŸš¦ What is a Job?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Job** in Databricks is a way to automate the execution of notebooks, scripts, or workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can:\n",
    "- Schedule jobs to run at specific intervals\n",
    "- Chain tasks together using dependencies\n",
    "- Trigger workflows on-demand or based on events\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§© Pipelines & Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, weâ€™ve set up a modular workflow using **Databricks Workflows**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **task** represents a single notebook (e.g., ingest, transform, write)\n",
    "- Tasks are named and ordered for readability: `01_`, `02_`, `D04_`, etc.\n",
    "- Dependencies are defined by connecting outputs from one notebook to inputs for the next\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Benefits of This Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular**: Each notebook does one thing (e.g., ingest finance data)\n",
    "- **Scalable**: You can add tasks (like `streaming_ingest`) without breaking existing code\n",
    "- **Re-runnable**: You can rerun specific tasks or the full DAG\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ Example Tasks in This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task Name | Purpose |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|\n",
    "| `01_ingest_inventory_source` | Load mock inventory data from raw |\n",
    "| `D04_transform_silver_layer` | Apply business logic in Silver |\n",
    "| `D6_write_gold_summary` | Save joined/enriched output to Gold |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸš€ Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a trigger to run this pipeline on a schedule\n",
    "- Parameterize workflows for more dynamic execution\n",
    "- Add Git integration for version control\n",
