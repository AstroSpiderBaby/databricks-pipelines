üîê Azure AAD Token Generation for Databricks (Azure Key Vault Integration)
This guide outlines how to generate an AAD token using the Azure CLI so you can use it to create a Databricks secret scope backed by Azure Key Vault.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step
Open Command Prompt (not Git Bash for this step ‚Äî Git Bash may misinterpret the redirect):

az account get-access-token --resource=https://management.core.windows.net/ --query accessToken -o tsv > token.txt
Navigate to your working directory where token.txt is saved:

cd /c/Users/<YourUsername>/path/to/scripts
Verify the token file was generated using Git Bash or VS Code terminal:

cat token.txt
If you see a long JWT-style token, you're good (starts with eyJ...).

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues
Running in Git Bash may cause issues with redirection. Always run the command in Command Prompt or PowerShell when saving output to a file.

If token.txt looks empty, re-run in cmd.exe.

Git Bash can still be used after token is created (e.g., to run curl with the token).

üîê Using the Token
You can use the token to create the secret scope via curl:

curl -X POST https://adb-<your-id>.azuredatabricks.net/api/2.0/secrets/scopes/create \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat token.txt)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "scope": "lv426_kv",
  "scope_backend_type": "AZURE_KEYVAULT",
  "backend_azure_keyvault": {
    "resource_id": "/subscriptions/XXXX/resourceGroups/YYYY/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/your-keyvault",
    "dns_name": "https://your-keyvault.vault.azure.net/"
  }
}'
üßº Cleanup & Security
The token expires after a short time (~1 hour), so re-generate if needed.

Do not commit token.txt to source control.

Delete after use if possible:

rm token.txt
