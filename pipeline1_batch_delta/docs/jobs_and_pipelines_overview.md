# ðŸ§± Jobs and Pipelines in Databricks

This guide provides a quick overview of how Databricks Jobs and Workflows are used to orchestrate modular pipelines.

---

## ðŸš¦ What is a Job?

A **Job** in Databricks is a way to automate the execution of notebooks, scripts, or workflows.

You can:
- Schedule jobs to run at specific intervals
- Chain tasks together using dependencies
- Trigger workflows on-demand or based on events

---

## ðŸ§© Pipelines & Tasks

In this project, weâ€™ve set up a modular workflow using **Databricks Workflows**:

- Each **task** represents a single notebook (e.g., ingest, transform, write)
- Tasks are named and ordered for readability: `01_`, `02_`, `D04_`, etc.
- Dependencies are defined by connecting outputs from one notebook to inputs for the next

---

## âœ… Benefits of This Structure

- **Modular**: Each notebook does one thing (e.g., ingest finance data)
- **Scalable**: You can add tasks (like `streaming_ingest`) without breaking existing code
- **Re-runnable**: You can rerun specific tasks or the full DAG

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example Tasks in This Project

| Task Name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `01_ingest_inventory_source` | Load mock inventory data from raw |
| `D04_transform_silver_layer` | Apply business logic in Silver |
| `D6_write_gold_summary` | Save joined/enriched output to Gold |

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Add a trigger to run this pipeline on a schedule
- Parameterize workflows for more dynamic execution
- Add Git integration for version control
