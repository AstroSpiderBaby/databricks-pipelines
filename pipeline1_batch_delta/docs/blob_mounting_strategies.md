# üìÑ Blob Mounting Strategies (Legacy)

This notebook demonstrates two methods for mounting Azure Blob Storage containers in Databricks.

## Purpose:
To showcase alternative credential handling strategies prior to adopting secure secret management via Azure Key Vault.

## Mounting Methods Covered:
1. **Manual Key Injection**  
   - Requires direct entry of the Azure Storage account key.
   - Demonstrates how to build and mount using hardcoded credentials (not recommended for production).

2. **Databricks Secret Scope**  
   - Retrieves the storage account key from a Databricks-managed secret scope.
   - Suitable for development environments with basic secret rotation policies.

## Notes:
- These methods are maintained for historical reference and debugging.
- For production workloads, it is strongly recommended to use Azure Key Vault integration as shown in `azure_key_vault_setup`.
